C is statically typed, imperative and pretty unforgiving, which I like, personally.
When using gcc, the file is automatically renamed as a.out
gcc -o hello hello.c names it hello instead, for example
gcc -Wall gives warnings
gcc -Wall -o produces an object file
gcc -c combines them, I think

include directive similar to require in Perl, but only contains the promise of code.

Comments are with /* and */.

c doesn't have a print function, so you have to use printf with %d, etc.
function parameters are automatically lexically scoped
