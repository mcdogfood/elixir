class Rectangle
end

Methods are implemented in the usual way using def, i.e.

class Rectangle
  def perimeter
    2 * (@length + @breadth) # prefixed by @ are instance variables
  end
end

return keyword is used in subroutines, but, like Perl, the last computed result
is automatically returned

Methods that return nothing return the NilClass

up to 6.2
Can define default values for variables within a subroutine using =, e.g.
def (value=1, othervalue)
end

splat operator (*) is used to handle methods that have a variable number of parameters
e.g.
def functionVarPar(*paramList)

the .inject method iterates over them. Not quite sure how yet!
def add(*numbers)
  numbers.inject(0) { |sum, number| sum + number }
end
